          <h3>SINHARAJA FOREST RESERVE</h3>
          <P>A UNESCO-listed World Heritage Site and Biosphere Reserve, Sinharaja 
              Forest Reserve is the last viable area of primary tropical rainforest
              in Sri Lanka featuring tumbling waterfalls, bubbling pools and 
              emerald ferns. Situated in the south west of the island, the 
              forest’s canopy towers up to 45m and astonishingly over two-thirds of
              the trees are endemic, many of them even considered rare.

              However, one of the main reasons to visit Sinharaja is for the
               excellent birdwatching. The reserve supports over 80% of the 
               island’s bird species as well as being a habitat for endemic birds
               such as the green-billed coucal, the blue magpie and the red-faced
               malkoha. Butterflies, insects, amphibians and reptiles also live
               in this rich biodiverse reserve as well as mammals such as the rare
              leopard, purple-faced langur, rusty spotted cat and three types of squirrel.</P>

        <h3>HIKKADUWA MARINE NATIONAL PARK</h3>
        <P>Declared a Nature Reserve in 1988 and then upgraded to 
            national park status in 2002, the Hikkaduwa National Park 
            in the southern province is one of only two marine national
            parks in Sri Lanka. Although the southern coastline is home 
            to many coral reefs, the reefs in Hikkaduwa are the most diverse
            and accessible and offer some of the country’s best snorkelling 
            and diving opportunities.

            The main reef of Hikkaduwa sits in a sheltered lagoon, it is a typica
            l fringing reef with an average depth of about 5 metres. The coral 
            is colourful and diverse with around 60 different species including 
            boulder and encrusting corals, small-strands of Acropora coral and the 
            cabbage-like Montipora coral. The seagrass is home to sea turtles, whilst 
            tropical reef fish such as parrot fish, angel fish and butterfly fish skirt 
            through the corals. Along the outer slope of the reef, blacktip reef sharks can
            be found along with hawksbill and green turtles.</P>

        <h3>MINNERIYA NATIONAL PARK</h3>
        <P>Minneriya National Park sits in the north central province and with just over 
            300 square miles it remains one of the smallest parks in Sri Lanka. Despite 
            the reserve’s small size, it is home to a range of terrains including grasslands 
            and thick scrub, dry tropical forest and wetlands. Minneriya also features a
             man-made tank that filters to the reservoir and feeds the park’s wildlife during
              the dry months.

            Mammals found in Minneriya include deer, purple-faced langur and macaque monkeys,
             sloth bears and about 20 leopards, plus there is a wonderful range of migratory
              and indigenous birds throughout the park including the hanging parrot, 
              
              brown-capped babbler and green bee-eater. However, the star attraction of 
              the reserve is ‘The Gathering’; a spectacle where over 300 elephants congregate
               to the Minneriya reservoir as they search for water and fresh grass during the
                dry season (July – October). This wonderful event is the largest meeting of
                 Asian elephants in the world.</P>

                    a phenomenon commonly found in rainforests.  A hundred such flocks have been
                    systematically observed, and studies have revealed that some flocks contained
                     48 species, including 12 endemic to the island. The rare endemic birds to be
                     seen in the Sinharaja Rain Forest are the Red-faced Malkoha, the Sri Lanka
                    Blue Magpie, the Ashy-headed Babbler and the White-headed Starling.
                     The Green–billed Coucal has been given the title of being the Rarest of
